## Every value has a type.

*   Every value in a program has a specific type.
*   Integer (`int`): represents positive or negative whole numbers like 3 or -512.
*   Floating point number (`float`): represents real numbers like 3.14159 or -2.5.
*   Character string (usually called "string", `str`): text.
    *   Written in either single quotes or double quotes (as long as they match).
    *   The quote marks aren't printed when the string is displayed.

## Use the built-in function `type` to find the type of a value.

*   Use the built-in function `type` to find out what type a value has.
*   Works on variables as well.
    *   But remember: the *value* has the type --- the *variable* is just a label.

~~~
print(type(52))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
<class 'int'>
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
fitness = 'average'
print(type(fitness))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
<class 'str'>
~~~
{: .output}

## Types control what operations (or methods) can be performed on a given value.

*   A value's type determines what the program can do to it.

~~~
print(5 - 3)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
2
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
print('hello' - 'h')
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-67f5626a1e07> in <module>()
----> 1 print('hello' - 'h')

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'
~~~
{: .error}

## You can use the "+" and "*" operators on strings.

*   "Adding" character strings concatenates them.

~~~
full_name = 'Ahmed' + ' ' + 'Walsh'
print(full_name)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
Ahmed Walsh
~~~
{: .output}

*   Multiplying a character string by an integer _N_ creates a new string that consists of that character string repeated  _N_ times.
    *   Since multiplication is repeated addition.

~~~
separator = '=' * 10
print(separator)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
==========
~~~
{: .output}

## Strings have a length (but numbers don't).

*   The built-in function `len` counts the number of characters in a string.

~~~
print(len(full_name))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
11
~~~
{: .output}

*   But numbers don't have a length (not even zero).

~~~
print(len(52))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-3-f769e8e8097d> in <module>()
----> 1 print(len(52))

TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()
~~~
{: .error}

## <a name='convert-numbers-and-strings'></a> Must convert numbers to strings or vice versa when operating on them.

*   Cannot add numbers and strings.

~~~
print(1 + '2')
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-4-fe4f54a023c6> in <module>()
----> 1 print(1 + '2')

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
~~~
{: .error}

*   Not allowed because it's ambiguous: should `1 + '2'` be `3` or `'12'`?
*   Some types can be converted to other types by using the type name as a function.

~~~
print(1 + int('2'))
print(str(1) + '2')
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
3
12
~~~
{: .output}

## Can mix integers and floats freely in operations.

*   Integers and floating-point numbers can be mixed in arithmetic.
    *   Python 3 automatically converts integers to floats as needed. (Integer division in Python 2 will return an integer, the *floor* of the division.)

~~~
print('half is', 1 / 2.0)
print('three squared is', 3.0 ** 2)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
half is 0.5
three squared is 9.0
~~~
{: .output}

## Variables only change value when something is assigned to them.

*   If we make one cell in a spreadsheet depend on another,
    and update the latter,
    the former updates automatically.
*   This does **not** happen in programming languages.

~~~
first = 1
second = 5 * first
first = 2
print('first is', first, 'and second is', second)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
first is 2 and second is 5
~~~
{: .output}

*   The computer reads the value of `first` when doing the multiplication,
    creates a new value, and assigns it to `second`.
*   After that, `second` does not remember where it came from.

> 6. Average population of a city over time.

> > 2. Floating point, since fractional days are required
> > 3. Character string if serial number contains letters and numbers, otherwise integer if the serial number consists only of numerals
> > 4. This will vary! How do you define a specimen's age? whole days since collection (integer)? date and time (string)?
> > 5. Choose floating point to represent population as large aggregates (eg millions), or integer to represent population in units of individuals.
> > 6. Floating point number, since an average is likely to have a fractional part.

> ## Division Types
>
> In Python 3, the `//` operator performs integer (whole-number) floor division, the `/` operator performs floating-point
> division, and the '%' (or *modulo*) operator calculates and returns the remainder from integer division:
>
> ~~~
> print('5 // 3:', 5//3)
> print('5 / 3:', 5/3)
> print('5 % 3:', 5%3)
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
>
> ~~~
> 5 // 3: 1
> 5 / 3: 1.6666666666666667
> 5 % 3: 2
> ~~~
> {: .output}
>
> However in Python2 (and other languages), the `/` operator between two integer types perform a floor (`//`) division. To perform a float division, we have to convert one of the integers to float.
>
> ~~~
> print('5 // 3:', 1)
> print('5 / 3:', 1 )
> print('5 / float(3):', 1.6666667 )
> print('float(5) / 3:', 1.6666667 )
> print('float(5 / 3):', 1.0 )
> print('5 % 3:', 2)
> ~~~
>
> If `num_subjects` is the number of subjects taking part in a study,
> and `num_per_survey` is the number that can take part in a single survey,
> write an expression that calculates the number of surveys needed
> to reach everyone once.
>
> > ## Solution
> > We want the minimum number of surveys that reaches everyone once, which is
> > the rounded up value of `num_subjects / num_per_survey`. This is 
> > equivalent to performing an integer division with `//` and adding 1.
> > ~~~
> > num_subjects = 600
> > num_per_survey = 42
> > num_surveys = num_subjects // num_per_survey + 1
> >
> > print(num_subjects, 'subjects,', num_per_survey, 'per survey:', num_surveys)

> ## Strings to Numbers
>
> Where reasonable, `float()` will convert a string to a floating point number,
> and `int()` will convert a floating point number to an integer:
>
> ~~~
> print("string to float:", float("3.4"))
> print("float to int:", int(3.4))
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
>
> ~~~
> string to float: 3.4
> float to int: 3

> {: .output}

> If the conversion doesn't make sense, however, an error message will occur
