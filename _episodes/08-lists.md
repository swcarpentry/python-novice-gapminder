## Creating Lists

Multiple values can be stored in lists:

~~~
objectives = ['Create lists.', 'Extract items from lists.','Modify lists.']
print(type(objectives))
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
<class 'list'>
~~~
{: .output}

Sometimes we are not sure how many values we will have so we can start with an empty list and fill it sequentially.

~~~
objectives = []
print(objectives)
objectives.append("Create lists.")
print(objectives)
objectives.append('Extract items from lists.')
print(objectives)
objectives.append('Modify lists.')
print(objectives)
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
[]
['Create lists.']
['Create lists.','Extract items from lists.']
['Create lists.','Extract items from lists.','Modify lists.']
~~~
{: .output}

Lists can also contain different types of values:

~~~
objectives = [1, 'Create lists.', 2, 'Extract items from lists.', 3, 'Modify lists.']
~~~
{: .source}

## Accessing Multiple Values

If you want to take a slice from the beginning of a sequence, you can omit the first index in the range:

~~~
date = "Monday 4 January 2016"
day = date[0:6]
print("Using 0 to begin range:", day)
day = date[:6]
print("Omitting beginning index:", day)
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
Using 0 to begin range: Monday
Omitting beginning index: Monday
~~~
{: .output}

And equally, you can omit the ending index in the range to take a slice to the very end of the sequence:

~~~
months = ["jan", "feb", "mar", "apr", "may", "jun", "jul", "aug", "sep", "oct", "nov", "dec"]
sond = months[8:12]
print("With known last position:", sond)
sond = months[8:len(months)]
print("Using len() to get last entry:", sond)
sond = months[6:]
("Omitting ending index:", sond)
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
With known last position: ["sep", "oct", "nov", "dec"]
Using len() to get last entry: ["sep", "oct", "nov", "dec"]
Omitting ending index: ["sep", "oct", "nov", "dec"]
~~~
{: .output}

So far we've seen how to use slicing to take single blocks of successive entries from a sequence. But what if we want to take a subset of entries that aren't next to eachother in the sequence?

You can achieve this by providing a third argument to the range within the brackets, called the _step size_. The example below shows how you can take every third entry in a list:

~~~
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]
subset = primes[0:12:3]
print("subset", subset)
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
subset [2, 7, 17, 29]
~~~
{: .output}

Notice that the slice taken begins with the first entry in the range, followed by entries taken at equally-spaced intervals (the steps) thereafter. If you wanted to begin the subset with the third entry, you would need to specify that as the starting point of the sliced range:

~~~
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]
subset = primes[2:12:3]
print("subset", subset)
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
subset [5, 13, 23, 37]
~~~
{: .output}
