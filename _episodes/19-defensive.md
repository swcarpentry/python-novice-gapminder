title: "Defensive Programming"
teaching: 10
exercises: 15
questions:
- "What sorts of things frequently go wrong in programs?"
- "How can I make my programs more robust?"
objectives:
- "Diagnose corner cases in simple programs."
- "Write assertions with informative messages that test for corner cases in simple programs."
keypoints:
- FIXME
---
- Review of errors : SyntaxError, IndentationError, NameError, IndexError, FileNotFoundError
- Assertions - Say we know something about how we want our program to behave, we
  can use the **assert** keyword to have checks in our program
- Test a Fahrenheit to Celsius function

def convert_fahrenheit_to_celsius(input_temp_f):
    output_temp_c = 5/9*(input_temp_f - 32)
    return output_temp_c

assert convert_fahrenheit_to_celsius(212) == 100, 'Water boiling point conversion failed'

> ## Is This Needed?
>
> The `os` library contains a function called `os.path.exists(path)`
> that returns `True` if the file or directory identified by `path` exists,
> and `False` if it does not.
> A colleague of yours routinely uses it to check whether a file exists
> before trying to open it:
>
> ~~~
> ...
> assert os.path.exists(filename), 'File {0} not found'.format(filename)
> reader = open(filename, 'r')
> ...
> ~~~
> {: .source}

> Should you adopt this practice?
> Why or why not?

> ## Finding Corner Cases
>
> 1. Under what circumstances will the following function fail with an error?
> 2. Under what circumstances will it return something other than what the user would expect?
>
> ~~~
> def find_two_smallest(values):
>     "Find the two smallest values in a list."
>
>     copy = values[:]
>     copy.sort()
>     return copy[:2]

> ## Design by Contract
>
> 1. Explain in simple language what the function is supposed to do.
> 2. Fill in the blanks in the function definition so that all of the assertions succeed.
> 3. For what input(s) could different users reasonably expect this function to return different values?
>    I.e., where could reasonable people still disagree about the function's behavior?
> 4. Add one or more assertions to test for each situation identified above.
