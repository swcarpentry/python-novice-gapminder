## A *for loop* executes commands once for each value in a collection.

*   Doing calculations on the values in a list one by one
    is as painful as working with `pressure_001`, `pressure_002`, etc.
*   A *for loop* tells Python to execute some statements once for each value in a list,
    a character string,
    or some other collection.
*   "for each thing in this group, do these operations"

~~~
for number in [2, 3, 5]:
    print(number)
~~~
{: .python}

*   This `for` loop is equivalent to:

~~~
print(2)
print(3)
print(5)
~~~
{: .python}

*   And the `for` loop's output is:

~~~
2
3
5
~~~
{: .output}

## The first line of the `for` loop must end with a colon, and the body must be indented.

*   The colon at the end of the first line signals the start of a *block* of statements.
*   Python uses indentation rather than `{}` or `begin`/`end` to show *nesting*.
    *   Any consistent indentation is legal, but almost everyone uses four spaces.

~~~
for number in [2, 3, 5]:
print(number)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
IndentationError: expected an indented block
~~~
{: .error}

*   Indentation is always meaningful in Python.

~~~
firstName="Jon"
  lastName="Smith"
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
  File "<ipython-input-7-f65f2962bf9c>", line 2
    lastName="Smith"
    ^
IndentationError: unexpected indent
~~~
{: .error}

*   This error can be fixed by removing the extra spaces
    at the beginning of the second line.

## A `for` loop is made up of a collection, a loop variable, and a body.

~~~
for number in [2, 3, 5]:
    print(number)
~~~
{: .python}

*   The collection, `[2, 3, 5]`, is what the loop is being run on.
*   The body, `print(number)`, specifies what to do for each value in the collection.
*   The loop variable, `number`, is what changes for each *iteration* of the loop.
    *   The "current thing".

## Loop variables can be called anything.

*   As with all variables, loop variables are:
    *   Created on demand.
    *   Meaningless: their names can be anything at all.

~~~
for kitten in [2, 3, 5]:
    print(kitten)
~~~
{: .python}

## The body of a loop can contain many statements.

*   But no loop should be more than a few lines long.
*   Hard for human beings to keep larger chunks of code in mind.

~~~
primes = [2, 3, 5]
for p in primes:
    squared = p ** 2
    cubed = p ** 3
    print(p, squared, cubed)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
2 4 8
3 9 27
5 25 125
~~~
{: .output}

## Use `range` to iterate over a sequence of numbers.

*   The built-in function `range` produces a sequence of numbers.
    *   *Not* a list: the numbers are produced on demand
        to make looping over large ranges more efficient.
*   `range(N)` is the numbers 0..N-1
    *   Exactly the legal indices of a list or character string of length N

~~~
print('a range is not a list: range(0, 3)')
for number in range(0,3):
    print(number)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
a range is not a list: range(0, 3)
0
1
2
~~~
{: .output}

## The Accumulator pattern turns many values into one.

*   A common pattern in programs is to:
    1.  Initialize an *accumulator* variable to zero, the empty string, or the empty list.
    2.  Update the variable with values from a collection.

~~~
# Sum the first 10 integers.
total = 0
for number in range(10):
   total = total + (number + 1)
print(total)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
55
~~~
{: .output}

*   Read `total = total + (number + 1)` as:
    *   Add 1 to the current value of the loop variable `number`.
    *   Add that to the current value of the accumulator variable `total`.
    *   Assign that to `total`, replacing the current value.
*   We have to add `number + 1` because `range` produces 0..9, not 1..10.
