## Break programs down into functions to make them easier to understand.

*   Human beings can only keep a few items in working memory at a time.
*   Understand larger/more complicated ideas by understanding and combining pieces.
    *   Components in a machine.
    *   Lemmas when proving theorems.
*   Functions serve the same purpose in programs.
    *   *Encapsulate* complexity so that we can treat it as a single "thing".
*   Also enables *re-use*.
    *   Write one time, use many times.

## Define a function using `def` with a name, parameters, and a block of code.

*   Begin the definition of a new function with `def`.
*   Followed by the name of the function.
    *   Must obey the same rules as variable names.
*   Then *parameters* in parentheses.
    *   Empty parentheses if the function doesn't take any inputs.
    *   We will discuss this in detail in a moment.
*   Then a colon.
*   Then an indented block of code.

~~~
def print_greeting():
    print('Hello!')
~~~
{: .python}

## Defining a function does not run it.

*   Defining a function does not run it.
    *   Like assigning a value to a variable.
*   Must call the function to execute the code it contains.

~~~
print_greeting()
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
Hello!
~~~
{: .output}

## Arguments in call are matched to parameters in definition.

*   Functions are most useful when they can operate on different data.
*   Specify *parameters* when defining a function.
    *   These become variables when the function is executed.
    *   Are assigned the arguments in the call (i.e., the values passed to the function).
    *   If you don't name the arguments when using them in the call, the arguments will be matched to
parameters in the order the parameters are defined in the function.

~~~
def print_date(year, month, day):
    joined = str(year) + '/' + str(month) + '/' + str(day)
    print(joined)

print_date(1871, 3, 19)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
1871/3/19
~~~
{: .output}

Or, we can name the arguments when we call the function, which allows us to
specify them in any order:
~~~
print_date(month=3, day=19, year=1871)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
1871/3/19
~~~
{: .output}

*   Via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/minisciencegirl/status/693486088963272705):
    `()` contains the ingredients for the function
    while the body contains the recipe.

## Functions may return a result to their caller using `return`.

*   Use `return ...` to give a value back to the caller.
*   May occur anywhere in the function.
*   But functions are easier to understand if `return` occurs:
    *   At the start to handle special cases.
    *   At the very end, with a final result.

~~~
def average(values):
    if len(values) == 0:
        return None
    return sum(values) / len(values)
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
a = average([1, 3, 4])
print('average of actual values:', a)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
2.6666666666666665
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
print('average of empty list:', average([]))
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
None
~~~
{: .output}

*   Remember: [every function returns something]({{ page.root }}/04-built-in/).
*   A function that doesn't explicitly `return` a value automatically returns `None`.

> 1. Create a function definition for `print_egg_label()` that will work with the revised program above.  Note, the function's return value will be significant. Sample output might be `71.23 large`.
> 2.  A dirty egg might have a mass of more than 90 grams, and a spoiled or broken egg will probably have a mass that's less than 50 grams.  Modify your `print_egg_label()` function to account for these error conditions. Sample output could be `25 too light, probably spoiled`.

> ## Simulating a dynamical system
>
> In mathematics, a [dynamical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system) is a system in which a function describes the time dependence of a point in a geometrical space.  Canonical example of a dynamical system is a system called the [logistic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map).
>
>
> 1. Define a function called `logistic_map` that takes two inputs: `X`, representing the state of the system at time _t_, and a parameter `r`. This function should return a value representing the state of the system at time _t+1_.
>
> 2. Using a `for` loop, iterate the `logistic_map` function defined in part 1 starting from an initial condition of 0.5 for `T=10`, `100`, and `1000` periods. Store the intermediate results in a list so that after the `for` loop terminates you have accumulated a sequence of values representing the state of the logistic map at time _t=0,1,...,T_.
>
> 3. Encapsulate the logic of your `for` loop into a function called `iterate` that takes the initial condition as its first input, the parameter `T` as its second input and the parameter `r` as its third input. The function should return the list of values representing the state of the logistic map at time _t=0,1,...,T_.
