## Follow standard Python style in your code.

*   [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008):
    a style guide for Python that discusses topics such as how you should name variables,
    how you should use indentation in your code,
    how you should structure your `import` statements,
    etc.
    Adhering to PEP8 makes it easier for other Python developers to read and understand your code,
    and to understand what their contributions should look like.
    The [PEP8 application and Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8)
    can check your code for compliance with PEP8.

## Use assertions to check for internal errors.

Assertions are a simple, but powerful method for making sure that the context in which your code is executing is as you expect.

~~~
def calc_bulk_density(mass, volume):
    '''Return dry bulk density = powder mass / powder volume.'''
    assert volume > 0
    return mass / volume
~~~
{: .python}

If the assertion is `False`, the Python interpreter raises an `AssertionError` runtime exception. The source code for the expression that failed will be displayed as part of the error message. To ignore assertions in your code run the interpreter with the '-O' (optimize) switch. Assertions should contain only simple checks and never change the state of the program. For example, an assertion should never contain an assignment.

## Use docstrings to provide online help.

*   If the first thing in a function is a character string
    that is not assigned to a variable,
    Python attaches it to the function as the online help.
*   Called a *docstring* (short for "documentation string").

~~~
def average(values):
    "Return average of values, or None if no values are supplied."

    if len(values) == 0:
        return None
    return sum(values) / average(values)

help(average)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
Help on function average in module __main__:

average(values)
    Return average of values, or None if no values are supplied.

> ## Multiline Strings
>
> Often use *multiline strings* for documentation.
> These start and end with three quote characters (either single or double)
> and end with three matching characters.

> """This string spans
> multiple lines.

> Blank lines are allowed."""

> ## What Will Be Shown?
>
> Highlight the lines in the code below that will be available as online help.
> Are there lines that should be made available, but won't be?
> Will any lines produce a syntax error or a runtime error?
>

> ## Document This
>
> Turn the comment on the following function into a docstring
> and check that `help` displays it properly.

> ## Clean Up This Code
>
> 1. Read this short program and try to predict what it does.
> 2. Run it: how accurate was your prediction?
> 3. Refactor the program to make it more readable.
>    Remember to run it after each change to ensure its behavior hasn't changed.
> 4. Compare your rewrite with your neighbor's.
>    What did you do the same?
>    What did you do differently, and why?
