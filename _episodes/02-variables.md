## Use variables to store values.

*   **Variables** are names for values.
*   In Python the `=` symbol assigns the value on the right to the name on the left.
*   The variable is created when a value is assigned to it.
*   Here, Python assigns an age to a variable `age`
    and a name in quotes to a variable `first_name`.

~~~
age = 42
first_name = 'Ahmed'
~~~
{: .language-python}

*   Variable names
    * can **only** contain letters, digits, and underscore `_` (typically used to separate words in long variable names)
    * cannot start with a digit
*   Variable names that start with underscores like `__alistairs_real_age` have a special meaning
    so we won't do that until we understand the convention.

## Use `print` to display values.

*   Python has a built-in function called `print` that prints things as text.
*   Call the function (i.e., tell Python to run it) by using its name.
*   Provide values to the function (i.e., the things to print) in parentheses.
*   To add a string to the printout, wrap the string in single or double quotes.
*   The values passed to the function are called **arguments**

~~~
print(first_name, 'is', age, 'years old')
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
Ahmed is 42 years old
~~~
{: .output}

*   `print` automatically puts a single space between items to separate them.
*   And wraps around to a new line at the end.

## Variables must be created before they are used.

*   If a variable doesn't exist yet, or if the name has been mis-spelled,
    Python reports an error. (Unlike some languages, which "guess" a default value.)

~~~
print(last_name)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-c1fbb4e96102> in <module>()
----> 1 print(last_name)

NameError: name 'last_name' is not defined
~~~
{: .error}

*   The last line of an error message is usually the most informative.
*   We will look at error messages in detail [later]({{ page.root }}/15-scope/#reading-error-messages).

> ## Variables Persist Between Cells
>
> Be aware that it is the *order* of execution of cells that is important in a Jupyter notebook, not the order
> in which they appear. Python will remember *all* the code that was run previously, including any variables you have
> defined, irrespective of the order in the notebook. Therefore if you define variables lower down the notebook and then
> (re)run cells further up, those defined further down will still be present. As an example, create two cells with the
> following content, in this order:
>
> ~~~
> print(myval)
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
>
> ~~~
> myval = 1
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
>
> If you execute this in order, the first cell will give an error. However, if you run the first cell *after* the second
> cell it will print out `1`. To prevent confusion, it can be helpful to use the `Kernel` -> `Restart & Run All` option which
> clears the interpreter and runs everything from a clean slate going top to bottom.
{: .callout}

## Variables can be used in calculations.

*   We can use variables in calculations just as if they were values.
    *   Remember, we assigned the value `42` to `age` a few lines ago.

~~~
age = age + 3
print('Age in three years:', age)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
Age in three years: 45
~~~
{: .output}

## Use an index to get a single character from a string.

*   The characters (individual letters, numbers, and so on) in a string are
    ordered. For example, the string `'AB'` is not the same as `'BA'`. Because of
    this ordering, we can treat the string as a list of characters.
*   Each position in the string (first, second, etc.) is given a number. This
    number is called an **index** or sometimes a subscript.
*   Indices are numbered from 0.
*   Use the position's index in square brackets to get the character at that
    position.

~~~
atom_name = 'helium'
print(atom_name[0])
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
h
~~~
{: .output}

## Use a slice to get a substring.

*   A part of a string is called a **substring**. A substring can be as short as a
    single character.
*   An item in a list is called an element. Whenever we treat a string as if it
    were a list, the string's elements are its individual characters.
*   A slice is a part of a string (or, more generally, any list-like thing).
*   We take a slice by using `[start:stop]`, where `start` is replaced with the
    index of the first element we want and `stop` is replaced with the index of
    the element just after the last element we want.
*   Mathematically, you might say that a slice selects `[start:stop)`.
*   The difference between `stop` and `start` is the slice's length.
*   Taking a slice does not change the contents of the original string. Instead,
    the slice is a copy of part of the original string.

~~~
atom_name = 'sodium'
print(atom_name[0:3])
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
sod
~~~
{: .output}

## Use the built-in function `len` to find the length of a string.

~~~
print(len('helium'))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
6
~~~
{: .output}

*   Nested functions are evaluated from the inside out,
     like in mathematics.

## Python is case-sensitive.

*   Python thinks that upper- and lower-case letters are different,
    so `Name` and `name` are different variables.
*   There are conventions for using upper-case letters at the start of variable names so we will use lower-case letters for now.

## Use meaningful variable names.

*   Python doesn't care what you call variables as long as they obey the rules
    (alphanumeric characters and the underscore).

~~~
flabadab = 42
ewr_422_yY = 'Ahmed'
print(ewr_422_yY, 'is', flabadab, 'years old')
~~~
{: .language-python}

*   Use meaningful variable names to help other people understand what the program does.
*   The most important "other person" is your future self.

> ## Slicing concepts
>
> 1.  What does `thing[low:high]` do?
> 2.  What does `thing[low:]` (without a value after the colon) do?
> 3.  What does `thing[:high]` (without a value before the colon) do?
> 4.  What does `thing[:]` (just a colon) do?
> 5.  What does `thing[number:negative-number]` do?
> 6.  What happens when you choose a `high` value which is out of range? (i.e., try `atom_name[0:15]`) 
>
> > ## Solutions
> >
> > 1. `thing[low:high]` returns a slice from `low` to the value before `high`
> > 2. `thing[low:]` returns a slice from `low` to the end of `thing`
> > 3. `thing[:high]` returns a slice from the beginning of `thing` to the value before `high`
> > 4. `thing[:]` returns all of `thing`
> > 5. `thing[number:negative-number]` returns a slice from `number` to `negative-number` values from the end of `thing`
> > 6. If a part of the slice is out of range, the operation does not fail. `atom_name[0:15]` gives the same result as `atom_name[0:]`.
