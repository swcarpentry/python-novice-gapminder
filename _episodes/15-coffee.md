# Reflection exercise

Over break, reflect on and discuss the following:
* A common refrain in software engineering is "Don't Repeat Yourself". How do the techniques we've learned in the last
lessons help us avoid repeating ourselves? _Note that in practice there is some nuance to this and should be balanced
with doing the simplest thing that could possibly work._
* What are the pros / cons of making a variable global or local to a function? 
* When would you consider turning a block of code into a function definition?
