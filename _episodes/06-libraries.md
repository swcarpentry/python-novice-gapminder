## Most of the power of a programming language is in its libraries.

*   A *library* is a collection of files (called *modules*) that contains
    functions for use by other programs.
    *   May also contain data values (e.g., numerical constants) and other things.
    *   Library's contents are supposed to be related, but there's no way to enforce that.
*   The Python [standard library][stdlib] is an extensive suite of modules that comes
    with Python itself.
*   Many additional libraries are available from [PyPI][pypi] (the Python Package Index).
*   We will see later how to write new libraries.

## A program must import a library module before using it.

*   Use `import` to load a library module into a program's memory.
*   Then refer to things from the module as `module_name.thing_name`.
    *   Python uses `.` to mean "part of".
*   Using `math`, one of the modules in the standard library:

~~~
import math

print('pi is', math.pi)
print('cos(pi) is', math.cos(math.pi))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
pi is 3.141592653589793
cos(pi) is -1.0
~~~
{: .output}

*   Have to refer to each item with the module's name.
    *   `math.cos(pi)` won't work: the reference to `pi`
        doesn't somehow "inherit" the function's reference to `math`.

## Use `help` to learn about the contents of a library module.

*   Works just like help for a function.

~~~
help(math)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~

    The following documentation is automatically generated from the Python
    source files.  It may be incomplete, incorrect or include features that
    are considered implementation detail and may vary between Python
    implementations.  When in doubt, consult the module reference at the
    location listed above.

DESCRIPTION
    This module is always available.  It provides access to the
    mathematical functions defined by the C standard.

FUNCTIONS
    acos(x, /)
        Return the arc cosine (measured in radians) of x.

## Import specific items from a library module to shorten programs.

*   Use `from ... import ...` to load only specific items from a library module.
*   Then refer to them directly without library name as prefix.

~~~
from math import cos, pi

print('cos(pi) is', cos(pi))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
cos(pi) is -1.0
~~~
{: .output}

## Create an alias for a library module when importing it to shorten programs.

*   Use `import ... as ...` to give a library a short *alias* while importing it.
*   Then refer to items in the library using that shortened name.

~~~
import math as m

print('cos(pi) is', m.cos(m.pi))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
cos(pi) is -1.0
~~~
{: .output}

*   Commonly used for libraries that are frequently used or have long names.
    *   E.g., the `matplotlib` plotting library is often aliased as `mpl`.
*   But can make programs harder to understand,
    since readers must learn your program's aliases.

> ## Exploring the Math Module
>
> 1. What function from the `math` module can you use to calculate a square root
>    *without* using `sqrt`?
> 2. Since the library contains this function, why does `sqrt` exist?
>
> > ## Solution
> > 1. Using `help(math)` we see that we've got `pow(x,y)` in addition to `sqrt(x)`,
> >    so we could use `pow(x, 0.5)` to find a square root.
> > 2. The `sqrt(x)` function is arguably more readable than `pow(x, 0.5)` when
> >    implementing equations. Readability is a cornerstone of good programming, so it
> >    makes sense to provide a special function for this specific common case.
> >
> >    Also, the design of Python's `math` library has its origin in the C standard,
> >    which includes both `sqrt(x)` and `pow(x,y)`, so a little bit of the history
> >    of programming is showing in Python's function names.

> ## There Are Many Ways To Import Libraries!

> Match the following print statements with the appropriate library calls.

> Print commands:

> 1. `print("sin(pi/2) =", sin(pi/2))`
> 2. `print("sin(pi/2) =", m.sin(m.pi/2))`
> 3. `print("sin(pi/2) =", math.sin(math.pi/2))`

> Library calls:
>
> 1. `from math import sin, pi`
> 2. `import math`
> 3. `import math as m`
> 4. `from math import *`
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > 1. Library calls 1 and 4. In order to directly refer to `sin` and `pi` without
> >    the library name as prefix, you need to use the `from ... import ...`
> >    statement. Whereas library call 1 specifically imports the two functions
> >    `sin` and `pi`, library call 4 imports all functions in the `math` module.
> > 2. Library call 3. Here `sin` and `pi` are referred to with a shortened library
> >    name `m` instead of `math`. Library call 3 does exactly that using the
> >    `import ... as ...` syntax - it creates an alias for `math` in the form of
> >    the shortened name `m`.
> > 3. Library call 2. Here `sin` and `pi` are referred to with the regular library
> >    name `math`, so the regular `import ...` call suffices.

> ## Importing Specific Items
>
> 1. Fill in the blanks so that the program below prints `90.0`.
> 2. Do you find this version easier to read than preceding ones?
> 3. Why *wouldn't* programmers always use this form of `import`?
>
> ~~~
> ____ math import ____, ____
> angle = degrees(pi / 2)
> print(angle)
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
>
> > ## Solution

> > ~~~
> > from math import degrees, pi
> > angle = degrees(pi / 2)
> > print(angle)
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-python}

> > Most likely you find this version easier to read since it's less dense.
> > The main reason not to use this form of import is to avoid name clashes.
> > For instance, you wouldn't import `degrees` this way if you also wanted to
> > use the name `degrees` for a variable or function of your own. Or if you
> > were to also import a function named `degrees` from another library.

> ## Reading Error Messages
>
> 1. Read the code below and try to identify what the errors are without running it.
> 2. Run the code, and read the error message. What type of error is it?
>
> ~~~
> from math import log
> log(0)
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > 1. The logarithm of `x` is only defined for `x > 0`, so 0 is outside the
> >    domain of the function.
> > 2. You get an error of type "ValueError", indicating that the function
> >    received an inappropriate argument value. The additional message
> >    "math domain error" makes it clearer what the problem is.
