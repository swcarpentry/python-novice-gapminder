title: "Error Messages"
teaching: 5
exercises: 10
questions:
- "What kind of errors can occur in programs?"
- "How can I identify errors when they occur?"
objectives:
- "Read a traceback and determine the file, function, and line number on which the error occurred, the type of error, and the error message."
- "Correctly describe situations in which SyntaxError, IndentationError, NameError, IndexError, and FileNotFoundError occur."
keypoints:
- FIXME

> ## Reading Error Messages
>
> Read the traceback below, and identify the following:
>
> 1. How many levels does the traceback have?
> 2. What is the file name where the error occurred?
> 3. What is the function name where the error occurred?
> 4. On which line number in this function did the error occurr?
> 5. What is the type of error?
> 6. What is the error message?

> ## Identifying Syntax Errors
>
> 1. Read the code below and try to identify what the errors are
>    *without* running it.
> 2. Run the code and read the error message.
>    Is it a `SyntaxError` or an `IndentationError`?
> 3. Fix the error.
> 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you have fixed all the errors.

>    print("But at least python tells us about them!")
>   print("So they are usually not too hard to fix.")

> ## Identifying Variable Name Errors
>
> 1. Read the code below and try to identify what the errors are
>    *without* running it.
> 2. Run the code and read the error message.
>    What type of `NameError` do you think this is?
>    Is it a string with no quotes, a misspelled variable, or a variable that should have been defined but was not?
> 3. Fix the error.
> 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3, until you have fixed all the errors.

> 1. Read the code below and try to identify what the errors are

> 2. Run the code, and read the error message. What type of error is it?
