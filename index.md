This lesson is an introduction to programming Python for people with little or no previous programming experience.
It is designed to be used in both [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }}) and [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}) workshops,
and to serve as a worked example of how to develop a new lesson. Students should install Python and download the gapminder
data a day or two before the lesson ([see 'setup' for details]({{ site.github.url }}/setup/)).

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Learners need to understand the concepts of files and directories
> (including the working directory) and how to start a Python
> interpreter before tackling this lesson. This lesson references the Jupyter (IPython)
> Notebook although it can be taught through any Python interpreter.
> The commands in this lesson pertain to **Python 3**.
