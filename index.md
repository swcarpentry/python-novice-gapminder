This lesson is an introduction to programming Python
for people with little or no previous programming experience.
It uses plotting as its motivating example,
and is designed to be used in both [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }})
and [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}) workshops.
This lesson references the Jupyter Notebook,
but can be taught using a regular Python interpreter as well.
Please note that this lesson uses Python 3 rather than Python 2.
