subtitle: For Loops

> ## Learning Objectives
>
> * Learner will explain what `for` loops are normally used for.
> * Learner will trace the execution of a simple (unnested) loop
>   and correctly state the values of variables in each iteration.
> * Learner will write `for` loops that use the Accumulator pattern
>   to aggregate values.

> ## Tracing Execution
>
> Create a table showing the numbers of the lines that are executed when this program runs,
> and the values of the variables after each line is executed.

> ## Reversing a String
>
> Fill in the blanks in the program below so that it prints "nit"
> (the reverse of the original character string "tin").
>
> ~~~
> original = "tin"
> result = ____
> for char in original:
>     result = ____
