## Reflection exercise

Over break, reflect on and discuss the following:

- A common refrain in software engineering is "Don't Repeat Yourself". How do the techniques we've learned in the last
  lessons help us avoid repeating ourselves? *Note that in practice there is some nuance to this and should be balanced
  with doing the simplest thing that could possibly work.*
- What are the pros / cons of making a variable global or local to a function?
- When would you consider turning a block of code into a function definition?
