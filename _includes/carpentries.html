    Since 1998,
    <a href="{{ site.swc_site }}">Software Carpentry</a>
    has been teaching researchers in science, engineering, medicine, and related disciplines
    the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain.
    Its volunteer instructors have run hundreds of events
    for thousands of learners in the past two and a half years.

    <a href="{{ site.dc_site }}">Data Carpentry</a> develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research.
    Its target audience is researchers who have little to no prior computational experience,
    and its lessons are domain specific,
    building on learners' existing knowledge to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own research.
