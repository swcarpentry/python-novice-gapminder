## Swapping Values
{: .challenge}

Draw a table showing the values of the variables in this program
after each statement is executed.
In simple terms, what do the last three lines of this program do?

~~~
lowest = 1.0
highest = 3.0
temp = lowest
lowest = highest
highest = temp
~~~
{: .python}

## Predicting Values
{: .challenge}

What is the final value of `position` in the program below?
(Try to predict the value without running the program,
then check your prediction.)

~~~
initial = "left"
position = initial
initial = "right"
~~~
{: .python}
