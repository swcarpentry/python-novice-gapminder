### Functions




### Built in Functions

### Getting Help



## What Happens When
{: .challenge}

1. Explain in simple terms the order of operations in the following program:
   when does the addition happen, when does the subtraction happen,
   when is each function called, etc.
2. What is the final value of `radiance`?

~~~
radiance = 1.0
radiance = max(2.0 + min(radiance, 1.1 * radiance - 0.5))
~~~
{: .python}

## Spot the Difference
{: .challenge}

1. Predict what each of the `print` statements in the program below will print.
2. Does `max(len(rich), poor)` run or produce an error message?
   If it runs, does its result make any sense?

~~~
rich = "gold"
poor = "tin"
print(max(rich, poor))
print(max(len(rich), len(poor)))
~~~
{: .python}

## Getting Help
{: .challenge}

Use `help` to determine what the function `round` does,
and write a program to round 3.141592653 to 3, 4, and 5 significant digits.
Do you agree with the answers?
