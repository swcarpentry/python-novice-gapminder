This lesson was developed using a slimmed-down variant of the "Understanding by Design" process.
The main sections are:

1.  Assumptions about audience, time, etc.
    (The current draft also includes some conclusions and decisions in this
    section - that should be refactored.)

2.  Desired results:
    overall goals, summative assessments at half-day granularity, what learners
    will be able to do, what learners will know.

3.  Learning plan:
    each episode has a heading that summarizes what will be covered,
    then estimates time that will be spent on teaching and on exercises,
    while the exercises are given as bullet points.

## Stage 1: Assumptions

*   Audience
    *   Graduate students in numerate disciplines from cosmology to archaeology
    *   Who have manipulated data in spreadsheets and with interactive tools like SAS
    *   But have *not* programmed beyond CPD (copy-paste-despair)
*   Constraints
    *   One full day 09:00-16:30
        *   06:15 class time
        *   0:45 lunch
        *   0:30 total for two coffee breaks
    *   Learners use native installs on their own machines
        *   May use VMs or cloud resources at instructor's discretion
        *   But must keep native local install as an option
    *   No dependence on other Carpentry modules
        *   In particular, does not require knowledge of shell or version control
    *   Use the Jupyter Notebook
        *   Authentic tool used by many instructors
        *   There isn't really an alternative
        *   And means that even people who have seen a bit of Python before
            will probably learn something
*   Motivating Example
    *   Creating 2D plots suitable for inclusion in papers
    *   Appeals to almost everyone
    *   Makes lesson usable by both Carpentries
        *   And means that even people who have seen a bit of Python before
            will probably learn something
*   Data
    *   Use the gapminder data throughout
    *   But break into multiple files by continent
        *   To make display of output from examples tidier
            (e.g., use Australia/New Zealand, which is only two lines)
        *   And allow examples showing use of multiple data sets
*   Focus on Pandas instead of NumPy
    *   Makes lesson usable by both Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry
    *   Genuine novices are likely to want data analysis
    *   And people with some prior experience:
        *   will accept data analysis as an authentic task,
        *   and are unlikely to have encountered Pandas,
            so they'll still get something useful out of the lesson
*   Challenges will mostly *not* be "write this code from scratch"
    *   Want lots of short exercises that can reliably be finished in allotted time
    *   So use MCQs, fill-in-the-blanks, Parsons Problems, "tweak this code", etc.

## Stage 2: Desired Results

### Questions

*   ...read tabular data?
*   ...plot a single vector of values?
*   ...create a time series plot?

    *   Meaningful variable names
    *   Modularity for readability as well as re-use
