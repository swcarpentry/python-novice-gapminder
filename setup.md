## Installing Python Using Anaconda

[Python][python] is a popular language for scientific computing, and great for
general-purpose programming as well. Installing all of its scientific packages
individually can be a bit difficult, however, so we recommend the all-in-one
installer [Anaconda][anaconda].

Regardless of how you choose to install it, please make sure you install Python
version 3.x (e.g., 3.4 is fine). Also, please set up your python environment at 
least a day in advance of the workshop.  If you encounter problems with the 
installation procedure, ask your workshop organizers via e-mail for assistance so
you are ready to go as soon as the workshop begins.

### Windows - [Video tutorial][video-windows]

1. Open [https://www.anaconda.com/download][continuum-windows]
   with your web browser.

2. Download the Python 3 installer for Windows.

3. Double-click the executable and install Python 3 using _MOST_ of the
   default settings. The only exception is to check the 
   **Make Anaconda the default Python** option.

### Mac OS X - [Video tutorial][video-mac]

1. Open [https://www.anaconda.com/download][continuum-mac]
   with your web browser.

2. Download the Python 3 installer for OS X.

3. Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation.

### Linux

Note that the following installation steps require you to work from the shell. 
If you run into any difficulties, please request help before the workshop begins.

1.  Open [https://www.anaconda.com/download][continuum-linux] with your web browser.

2.  Download the Python 3 installer for Linux.

3.  Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation.

    a.  Open a terminal window.

    b.  Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the installer

    c.  Type

    ~~~
    $ bash Anaconda3-
    ~~~
    {: .bash}

    and press tab.  The name of the file you just downloaded should appear.

    d.  Press enter.

    e.  Follow the text-only prompts.  When the license agreement appears (a colon
        will be present at the bottom of the screen) hold the down arrow until the 
        bottom of the text. Type `yes` and press enter to approve the license. Press 
        enter again to approve the default location for the files. Type `yes` and 
        press enter to prepend Anaconda to your `PATH` (this makes the Anaconda 
        distribution the default Python).

## Getting the Data

The data we will be using is taken from the [gapminder][gapminder] dataset.
To obtain it, download and unzip the file 
[python-novice-gapminder-data.zip]({{page.root}}/files/python-novice-gapminder-data.zip).
In order to follow the presented material, you should launch the JupyterLab 
server in the root directory (see [Starting Python](#Starting-Python)).
